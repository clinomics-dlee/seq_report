            <ul>
                <li>HIGH : The variant is assumed to have high (disruptive) impact in the protein, probably causing protein truncation, loss of function or
                    triggering nonsense mediated decay</li>
                <li>MODERATE : A non-disruptive variant that might change protein effectiveness.</li>
                <li>LOW : Assumed to be mostly harmless or unlikely to change protein behavior</li>
                <li>MODIFIER : Usually non-coding variants or variants affecting non-coding genes, where predictions are difficult or there is no
                    evidence of impact.</li>
